/*
 * App is the class that contains the main method. It is the entry point of the program.
 * App will have a GUI that will allow the user to interact with the program for these purposes:
 *     - The program should also display all scheduling information and require a confirmation from the user for
 *       each instance that the backup volunteer needs to be contacted.
 * 
 *     - Users should be provided with meaningful error messages appropriate to the audience
 *       (end user, rather than programmer). Error messages must explain what was wrong and
 *       how it can be corrected (e.g., "It was impossible to complete the schedule due to too
 *       many events scheduled at 11 AM. Please shift some of the following activities:
 *       rebandage head wound (Spike), administer antibiotics (Spike, Shadow)."
 * 
 *     - Users should be given the opportunity to correct their mistakes, and opportunities for
 *       mistakes should be limited.
