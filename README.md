# ENSF380_Final_Project

---

### Project Name

The project name is called ENSF380FinalProject. It doesn't have to be the same on everyone's machine but having the same name will make the version control process better.
All the source code is within the project folder inside the "src" folder. Inside the src folder is the package directory, "edu.ucalgary.oop".

---

### .gitignore

There is a gitignore file which ignores the lib folder used for library dependencies, bin folder used to store .class files. These files and folders do not need to be version controlled since it is not a part of the source code.

---

### App.java

The App.java file is a java class with the method `public static void main (String[] args)`
This is the entry point to the application and all the other classes can be instantiated within this method. Furthermore, it would make sense for the database connection to take place within this file.
